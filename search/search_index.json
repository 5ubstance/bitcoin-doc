In most cases, those filters will dismiss bitcoin as a scam right from the start. If this is your assessment after having had a first look I can\u2019t fault you. I totally understand. I went through the same thing. To grok bitcoin, you have to be minimally curious of course, but you almost need to take a leap of faith and literally \u201ctrust\u201d that whoever or whatever got you to look into it actually did so in good faith and had your best interest in mind. Unfortunately, the current state of the world we live in means that, since trust has mostly disappeared (thanks to the ever growing number of spam emails, telemarketers, financial scams, fake news and the like), the effort first required to successfully dive in and see through the ocean of bullshit is tremendous. Even more so today with the advent of the shitcoin economy (but that is a whole other discussion). And it can feel like it's getting harder by the day. The big questions Why does Bitcoin exist? The main goal of bitcoin is to separate money from the state (read : government) and the only reason it really has a chance to do so is beacause of a little thing called decentralization which is, in my opinion, bitcoin's most important feature. Decentralization is the main reason we can think of bitcoin as \"unstoppable money\". A money where you are free to make the transaction everybody (government but also businesses and individuals) says you can't make. What is bitcoin? Analogies and comparisons When first trying to understand bitcoin, analogies can be valuable tools to build models from. The next bitcoin vs gold bitcoin as layers TODO : Lightning network. The qualities of money (currency?) Fungibility TODO : One of the qualities often mentioned when attempting to define what a functioning currency might be is fungibility. Store of value TODO Medium of exchange TODO Divisibility TODO the fud it's mostly used by criminals Taken from Forbes : The majority of cryptocurrency is not used for criminal activity. According to an excerpt from Chainalysis\u2019 2021 report, in 2019, criminal activity represented 2.1% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume (roughly $21.4 billion worth of transfers). In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% ($10.0 billion in transaction volume). According to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity. This means that criminal activity using cryptocurrency transactions is much smaller than fiat currency and its use is going down year by year. Also, it seems to me a free (as in freedom) and transparent ledger might not be the best system to conduct criminal activities. the government will kill it No. They can't. How would they? Laws? First, bitcoin cares little about laws. Furthermore, since the network is global, any law which cannot be orchestrated globally in unison just means arbitrage will happen between countries and network actors will be incentivized to move to more bitcoin-favorable nation-states. Stopping the data flow? At this stage in the game, to stop bitcoin, you would pretty much need to stop the flow of information on which the bitcoin nodes rely. This means stopping the internet or actively filtering it in a way nodes and miners cannot continue working. The wide availability of technologies like Tor and VPNs means circumventing this filtering is easy. This is not happening but they are welcome to try. Historically though, attacks on the bitcoin network have mostly worked to its advantage, making it more robust (anti-fragile as Taleb might say...) in the long run. it uses too much energy TODO : What is too much? it's destroying the environment TODO : More than the current system? nobody uses it TODO it's inefficient/slow TODO it's too risky/volatile Yes. Bitcoin is volatile (when compared to usd for instance). It is however fairly young when compared to other assets (gold) or currencies (usd). As such, it is still going through a phase of price discovery where the price will fluctuate according to its perceived value by economic actors. Deal with it. On a long enough timeframe, bitcoin still has infinite upside. TODO : Source for \"Also, on a risk-adjusted basis, it is currently one of the best investment you can make.\" it\u2019s too expensive People often think they have to buy a \"whole\" bitcoin but that is just not true. What they don't know is that bitcoins are subdivisible down to the eight (8) decimal point (e.g. 0.00000001). By the way, that specific unit is called a \"satoshi\". This means that people wanting to buy bitcoin can buy whatever amount they want. They most certainly do not have to shell out 50k USD all at once to get their hands on a full bitcoin. They can just buy whatever they need. And they will do so at the price they deserve. you can\u2019t buy it anymore TODO there's so many bitcoins to chose from, I don't know which one to buy There is only one bitcoin. Its ticker symbol is BTC. This can be very confusing for newcomers to the space and is a subject of much controversy, even for experts. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold... These other \"versions\" (forks) of bitcoin are all really just copies, even though people familiar with them will often tout their supremacy over bitcoin for x and y reasons. Remember, there is a reason why they trade at a lower valuation (price) : they are a lot less valuable.

More guides involving other wallets might become available later (pull requests welcome). Install the wallet android TODO : better android support Open android's appstore. Search for \"blue wallet\". Install the app. iPhone Open apple's appstore. Hit the search button (usually on the bottom right) and type \"blue wallet\". Optionally, click the following link which will bring you to BlueWallet directly . Only install BlueWallet . Not something that looks like BlueWallet. Not CyanWallet. Not TheOneAndOnlyBlueWallet. BlueWallet . Beware of malicious apps. Start the wallet app Open BlueWallet and click on \"Add now\" (this only shows up when you don't already have a wallet setup). If for some reason the \"Add now\" button is not available, click on the \"+\" icon in the top right corner. Enter a name for the wallet. Name it something relevant like \"savings\" (remember, bitcoin is a savings technology :) ) For the type of account, select \"Bitcoin\". Click on \"Create\". Upon clicking create, you will be presented with 12 words (seed words). Save those in a safe place (see below for warnings regarding adequately storing a bitcoin private key). Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a bitcoin wallet/account and can start transacting on the Bitcoin network On storing seed words (the 12 words you wrote down earlier) Think of these words as the ONLY \"key\" that can open your bitcoin \"safe deposit box\". If you lose them, you lose access to your bitcoin. If you share them (or they get stolen somehow), that person now has access to your bitcoin. The amount of energy you put into securing this key should be equivalent to the value that you store in your wallet (e.g. it's ok to save these on dropbox if you only put a few bucks on there to play with but if you are putting a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin on there, you might want to think a bit more about how to properly secure your key. However, this is outside the scope of this article. TODO : add documentation regarding storing a bitcoin private key Receive your first bitcoin In order to fund your new wallet with bitcoins, you need to know someone who can send you some satoshis (the smallest bitcoin unit, 0.00000001 btc) or buy some sats from some bitcoin onramp. Here are a few recommandations : Shakepay (Canada, easiest, uses my personal referral link to get you and me 10$ each) Bull Bitcoin (Canada) Swan Bitcoin (United States) Once you are ready to receive your first sats : Open the BlueWallet app. In BlueWallet , click on the wallet you just created. On the bottom, click on \"receive\". You will be presented with a QR code and a strange looking string (e.g. bc1hiuesijeiw...). The long string is your bitcoin address and the QR code is the visual representation of that same address. This address can be used by you or someone else trying to send you sats. Make sure you copy it and don't try to enter it manually, this is a bad idea. This next step will be different depending on which onramp you are using. In general, you need to enter an amount to send in btc (e.g. 0.001 btc or 100000 sats) and enter the destination address you copied earlier. You might also have to enter a fee. Ideally, a good fee will be pre-selected so use that for now. When ready, press send and in a matter of seconds, you should see the funds appear in your BlueWallet wallet. Congratulations!
