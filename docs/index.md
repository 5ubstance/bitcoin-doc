## Understanding bitcoin

One of the problem with innovations like bitcoin is that, on the surface, it can look like one (or a combination) of the following things :

- a risky and/or volatile investment 
- an environmental catastrophe 
- fake money, a scam, a ponzi or a “greater fool” trap
- a system only used by criminals

In this day and age, most of us have developed heuristics to filter bullshit. In most cases, those filters will dismiss bitcoin as a scam right from the start. 
If this is your assessment after having had a first look I can’t fault you. I totally understand. I went through the same thing.

To grok bitcoin, you have to be minimally curious of course, but you almost need to take a leap of faith and literally “trust” that whoever or whatever got you to look into it actually did so in good faith and had your best interest in mind. Unfortunately, the current state of the world we live in means that, since trust has mostly disappeared (thanks to the ever growing number of spam emails, telemarketers, financial scams, fake news and the like), the effort first required to successfully dive in and see through the ocean of bullshit is tremendous. Even more so today with the advent of the shitcoin economy. And it can feel like it's getting harder by the day.

## why bitcoin?

In my opinion, the single most important feature of bitcoin is its decentralization.

Consensus can be enforced via decentralization.

Unstoppable money.

## the fud

### it's mostly used by criminals

Taken from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2021/01/19/the-false-narrative-of-bitcoins-role-in-illicit-activity) :

> The majority of cryptocurrency is not used for criminal activity. According to an excerpt from Chainalysis’ 2021 report, in 2019, criminal activity represented 2.1% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume (roughly $21.4 billion worth of transfers). In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% ($10.0 billion in transaction volume). 
>
> According to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity. This means that criminal activity using cryptocurrency transactions is much smaller than fiat currency and its use is going down year by year.

Also, it seems to me a free (as in freedom) and transparent ledger might not be the best system to conduct criminal activities.

### the government will kill it

No.

They can't. How would they?

Laws?

First, bitcoin cares little about laws. Furthermore, since the network is global, any law which cannot be orchestrated globally in unison just means arbitrage will happen between countries and network actors will be incentivized to move to more bitcoin-favorable nation-states.

Stopping the data flow?

At this stage in the game, to stop bitcoin, you would pretty much need to stop the flow of information on which the bitcoin nodes rely. This means stopping the internet or actively filtering it in a way nodes and miners cannot continue working. The wide availability of technologies like Tor and VPNs means circumventing this filtering is easy.

This is not happening but they are welcome to try.

Historically though, attacks on the bitcoin network have mostly worked to its advantage, making it more robust (anti-fragile as Taleb might say...) in the long run.

### it uses too much energy

What is too much?

### it's destroying the environment

More than the current system?

### nobody uses it

### it's inefficient

### it's slow

### it's risky

### it's volatile

Yes. Bitcoin is volatile (when compared to usd for instance).

It is however fairly young when compared to other assets (gold) or currencies (usd). As such, it is still going through a phase of price discovery where the price will fluctuate according to its perceived value by economic actors.

Deal with it.

On a long enough timeframe, bitcoin still has infinite upside.
