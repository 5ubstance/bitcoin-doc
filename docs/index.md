## Understanding bitcoin

One of the problems with innovations like bitcoin is that, on the surface, it can look like one (or a combination) of the following things :

- a risky and/or volatile investment 
- an environmental catastrophe 
- fake money, a scam, a ponzi or a “greater fool” trap
- a system only used by criminals

In this day and age, most of us have developed heuristics to filter bullshit. In most cases, those filters will dismiss bitcoin as a scam right from the start. 
If this is your assessment after having had a first look I can’t fault you. I totally understand. I went through the same thing.

To grok bitcoin, you have to be minimally curious of course, but you almost need to take a leap of faith and literally “trust” that whoever or whatever got you to look into it actually did so in good faith and had your best interest in mind. Unfortunately, the current state of the world we live in means that, since trust has mostly disappeared (thanks to the ever growing number of spam emails, telemarketers, financial scams, fake news and the like), the effort first required to successfully dive in and see through the ocean of bullshit is tremendous. Even more so today with the advent of the shitcoin economy (but that is a whole other discussion). And it can feel like it's getting harder by the day.

## The big questions

### Why does Bitcoin exist?

The main goal of bitcoin is to separate money from the state (read : government) and the only reason it really has a chance to do so is beacause of a little thing called decentralization which is, in my opinion, bitcoin's most important feature.

Decentralization is the main reason we can think of bitcoin as "unstoppable money". A money where you are free to make the transaction everybody (government but also businesses and individuals) says you can't make.

## the fud

### it's mostly used by criminals

Taken from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2021/01/19/the-false-narrative-of-bitcoins-role-in-illicit-activity) :

> The majority of cryptocurrency is not used for criminal activity. According to an excerpt from Chainalysis’ 2021 report, in 2019, criminal activity represented 2.1% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume (roughly $21.4 billion worth of transfers). In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% ($10.0 billion in transaction volume). 
>
> According to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity. This means that criminal activity using cryptocurrency transactions is much smaller than fiat currency and its use is going down year by year.

Also, it seems to me a free (as in freedom) and transparent ledger might not be the best system to conduct criminal activities.

### the government will kill it

No.

They can't. How would they?

Laws?

First, bitcoin cares little about laws. Furthermore, since the network is global, any law which cannot be orchestrated globally in unison just means arbitrage will happen between countries and network actors will be incentivized to move to more bitcoin-favorable nation-states.

Stopping the data flow?

At this stage in the game, to stop bitcoin, you would pretty much need to stop the flow of information on which the bitcoin nodes rely. This means stopping the internet or actively filtering it in a way nodes and miners cannot continue working. The wide availability of technologies like Tor and VPNs means circumventing this filtering is easy.

This is not happening but they are welcome to try.

Historically though, attacks on the bitcoin network have mostly worked to its advantage, making it more robust (anti-fragile as Taleb might say...) in the long run.

### it uses too much energy

TODO : What is too much?

### it's destroying the environment

TODO : More than the current system?

### nobody uses it

TODO

### it's inefficient/slow

TODO

### it's too risky/volatile

Yes. Bitcoin is volatile (when compared to usd for instance).

It is however fairly young when compared to other assets (gold) or currencies (usd). As such, it is still going through a phase of price discovery where the price will fluctuate according to its perceived value by economic actors.

Deal with it.

On a long enough timeframe, bitcoin still has infinite upside.

### it’s too expensive

People often think they have to buy a "whole" bitcoin but that is just not true. What they don't know is that bitcoins are subdivisible down to the eight (8) decimal point (e.g. 0.00000001).

By the way, that specific unit is called a "satoshi".

This means that people wanting to buy bitcoin can buy whatever amount they want. They most certainly do not have to shell out 50k USD all at once to get their hands on a full bitcoin. They can just buy whatever they need. And they will do so at the price they deserve.

### you can’t buy it anymore

TODO

### there's so many bitcoins to chose from, I don't know which one to buy

There is only one bitcoin. Its ticker symbol is BTC.

This can be very confusing for newcomers to the space and is a subject of much controversy, even for experts. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold... These other "versions" (forks) of bitcoin are all really just copies, even though people familiar with them will often tout their supremacy over bitcoin for x and y reasons. Remember, there is a reason why they trade at a lower valuation (price) : they are a lot less valuable.

This could seem attractive to some at first : an investment in those "coins" would mean more coin for the same fiat amount (USD, CAD, ...), right?

Wrong.

These other coins are :

- incompatible with the real bitcoin blockchain
- less secure
- less liquid

Remember : there is only one bitcoin and its ticker symbol is BTC.
